This page summarizes the results of the MSCA project **Taming, controlling and harnessing quantum complexity (TaQC)**, for the period 04/2024 -- 02/2025.

**Synopsis**: Entanglement is a cornerstone of quantum science and technology. Its systematic analysis and the ex­ploitation of the complex correlation structures it provides have sparked technological advances bound to revolutionize a vast array of fields. On the other hand, the potential of quantum memory – entanglement’s temporal counterpart – has not yet been unlocked for lack of an adequate conceptual framework. Drawing on novel insights from quantum information theory and classical complexity, this project sets out to overcome this challenge and provide the tools to tame, control and harness entanglement in time. These results will culminate in a comprehensive and experimentally amenable complexity theory for quantum processes with ground­breaking consequences for the prediction, compres­sion and simulation of both natural and engineered quantum systems.

All works that have received funding through this MSCA fellowship are listed below.

In this work, we provide a pedagogical introduction to the field of Higher Order Quantum Operations (HOQOs) and offer a review of their multifaceted areas of application. HOQOs form the mathematical underpinnings for the study of complex quantum processes, and have been rediscovered as versatile tools for the optimisation of quantum information processing tasks, the description of memory and multi-time quantum phenomena, as well as the investigation of causality in quantum mechanics. This pre-print aims introduce to bridg the gap between these conceptually different different fields of research.

How "valuable" is a quantum process? In this work, we provide the means to answer this question by monotones to quantify the resourcefulness of quantum processes. Employing this framework, for example, the usefulness of a process for the task of dynamical decoupling can be gauged. In addition, these monotones connect neatly to process distinguishability measures introduced here. As a nice benefit, derivation of these general monotones fixes technical issues that previously introduced monotones encountered (as pointed out by Guilherme Zambon in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevA.110.042210">this</a> nice publication), and connect neatly to known measures of process distinguishability.

    This image can also have a caption. It's like magic.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images, even citations {% cite einstein1950meaning %}.
Say you wanted to write a bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, _bled_ for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>





The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

{% raw %}

```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
  <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
</div>
```

{% endraw %}
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
  <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/project_1/EN_FundedbytheEU_RGB_POS.png" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
</div>
