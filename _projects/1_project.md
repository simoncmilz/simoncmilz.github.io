This page summarizes the results of the MSCA project **Taming, controlling and harnessing quantum complexity (TaQC)**, for the period 04/2024 -- 02/2025.

**Synopsis**: Entanglement is a cornerstone of quantum science and technology. Its systematic analysis and the ex­ploitation of the complex correlation structures it provides have sparked technological advances bound to revolutionize a vast array of fields. On the other hand, the potential of quantum memory – entanglement’s temporal counterpart – has not yet been unlocked for lack of an adequate conceptual framework. Drawing on novel insights from quantum information theory and classical complexity, this project sets out to overcome this challenge and provide the tools to tame, control and harness entanglement in time. These results will culminate in a comprehensive and experimentally amenable complexity theory for quantum processes with ground­breaking consequences for the prediction, compres­sion and simulation of both natural and engineered quantum systems.

All works that have received funding through this MSCA fellowship are listed below.

In this work, we provide a pedagogical introduction to the field of Higher Order Quantum Operations (HOQOs) and offer a review of their multifaceted areas of application. HOQOs form the mathematical underpinnings for the study of complex quantum processes, and have been rediscovered as versatile tools for the optimisation of quantum information processing tasks, the description of memory and multi-time quantum phenomena, as well as the investigation of causality in quantum mechanics. This manuscript aims to bridge the gap between these conceptually different different areas of research, and offer a comprehensive overview of the main techniques for researchers that are new to the field.

How "valuable" is a quantum process? In this work, we provide the means to answer this question by introducing monotones that quantify the resourcefulness of quantum processes. Employing this framework, for example, the usefulness of quantum processes for the task of dynamical decoupling can be gauged in a systematic manner. In addition, these monotones connect neatly to known measures of process distinguishability. As a nice benefit, the derivation of these general monotones fixes technical issues that previously introduced monotones encountered (as pointed out by Guilherme Zambon in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevA.110.042210">this</a> nice publication).

<strong>July 17, 2024</strong>: Somewhat clunky a title, but definitely worth a read: our manuscript on <strong>Characterising transformations between quantum objects, ‘completeness’ of quantum properties, and transformations without a fixed causal order</strong> has been published in <a href="https://doi.org/10.22331/q-2024-07-17-1415">Quantum</a>.

The basic elements of quantum mechanics are states and channels, the mathematical properties of which are well understood and readily deduced. A priori, there is no need to stop at considering channels -- transformations of states. One could, for example, wish to investigate the properties of superchannels -- transformations of channels -- supersuperchannels -- transformations of superchannels -- etc. All elements of the ensuing hierarchy of transformations come with their own structural properties, and many of them play an important role in foundational and applied quantum information. Their investigation and the apraisal of their resources requires, as a crucial first step, their mathematical characterisation. In this work, leveraging projector-based techniques, we provide systematic means for such a characterisation of the structural properties of arbitrary quantum objects, offering a versatile tool for the study of higher order quantum transformations.

In collaboration with <strong>Philip Taranto</strong> (University of Manchester), <strong>Marco Túlio Quintino</strong> (Sorbonne Université), and <strong>Mio Murao</strong> (University of Tokyo), we show that, quantum processes display a fascinating variety of different memory effects -- even when said memory is restricted to be classical. While quantum processses display their full potential when they can transmit genuinely quantum information between different points in time, the control and implementation of such intricate resources is generally still out of experimental reach. This makes the investigation of processes with purely classical memory effects and the decuction of the power for information theoretic tasks that they can display an important intermediate step towards the practical exploitation of memory effects in quantum processes. In this work, we uncover the rich hierarchy of non-equivalent types of classical memory effects in quantum processes, and demonstrate the different physical mechanisms that underpin them.
