  I'm an Assistant Professor at the 
  <a href="https://www.hw.ac.uk/uk/schools/engineering-physical-sciences/institutes/photonics-quantum-sciences.htm" target="_blank">
    Institute of Photonics and Quantum Sciences (IPAQS)
  </a> at Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 19px; line-height: 1.8;">
  My research interests lie at the intersection of Quantum Information Theory, the field of Open Quantum System Dynamics, and the study of causality in quantum mechanics.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 19px; line-height: 1.8;">
  I am particularly interested in the role that complex memory effects play in the dynamics of quantum systems, and study how to control and exploit them for practical tasks. In addition, my research focuses on the investigation of causal and causally disordered signalling structures in higher-order quantum processes, as well as the demarcation line between classical and quantum phenomena.

  Have a look at my 
  <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=GSDfoHMAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Google Scholar profile</a> and my 
  <a href="https://arxiv.org/search/quant-ph?searchtype=author&query=Milz,+S" target="_blank">arXiv submissions</a> for an up-to-date list of my publications.
